# WP Country Codes Taxonomy

This plugin creates and pre-populates a *countries* WordPress taxonomy using 2-character country codes as slugs.

## I pinched most of this from

The basic create and populate functionality came wholesale from a great [WP Theme Tutorial] (https://github.com/curtismchale/WP-Theme-Tutorial---US-States-Plugin-for-WordPress) by Curis McHale.

The country code dataset is courtesy of Luke Duncalfe's awesome [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes).

## Installation

It's a WordPress plugin so...

1. Extract to your wp-content/plugins/ folder
2. Activate the plugin
